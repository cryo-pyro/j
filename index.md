# A. Technical Proposal (Draft)

**Assignment:** Monitoring and Evaluation Consultant to Support the Operationalization of the Multi‑Donor Gender Equality Trust Fund (GETF)
**Applicant:** Martin Muwaga
**Date:** 12 September 2025 (to match RFP deadline timezone)
**Submission:** Technical and financial proposals to be submitted in **separate files** by email.

---

## 1) Executive Summary

I propose to lead the Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (MEL) function for the GETF Secretariat, establishing an adaptive Monitoring & Results Measurement (MRM) system, coordinating data collection and partner reporting, and producing high‑quality donor reports and knowledge products aligned to AfDB standards. With 20+ years of experience across USAID, AfDB, UN WFP, DFID/UK, Government of Uganda, and DANIDA programmes, I will consolidate GETF data flows (grants to FIs, incubators/accelerators, research institutions, and public entities), embed gender‑transformative indicators, and strengthen evidence for decision‑making toward AFAWA’s objective of unlocking finance for women entrepreneurs.

---

## 2) Understanding of the Assignment and Context

**Strategic context:** GETF under AFAWA supports (i) the effective implementation of AFAWA and (ii) gender‑transformative lending and non‑lending operations via multi‑donor grants. The Consultant works within the GETF Secretariat, under the AFAWA Coordinator, to monitor progress, evaluate outcomes, and ensure efficient delivery.

**Implications for MEL:**

* A portfolio with multiple implementing partners requires harmonised results chains, indicator definitions, and reporting cycles.
* The M\&E online system must consolidate data (quantitative + qualitative) and ensure traceability for baselines, targets, and results—enabling quarterly/semester/annual reporting and mid‑term/final reviews.
* Gender‑transformative impact must be made visible through sex‑disaggregated indicators and case studies capturing significant change for women‑led MSMEs.

# B.  📄 Technical Proposal – Expanded Draft

## 1. Strategic Context (expand to 2–3 paragraphs)

The Affirmative Finance Action for Women in Africa (AFAWA) is the African Development Bank’s flagship initiative to close the \$42 billion financing gap for women-led small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). Within this initiative, the **Gender Equality Trust Fund (GETF)** serves as a multi-donor financing platform, pooling resources from bilateral and multilateral partners to catalyze gender-transformative change. The GETF Secretariat is tasked with ensuring that financial flows are strategically deployed, that lessons from implementation are captured, and that donor accountability requirements are fully met.

Operationalizing such a facility requires an **adaptive Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) system** capable of managing complexity across diverse implementing partners—including financial intermediaries, accelerators, incubators, research institutions, and government entities. Each partner brings unique mandates, data practices, and capacity levels. Harmonizing these within a single results framework, while ensuring comparability across contexts, is critical. The MEL function must therefore combine rigorous quantitative tracking with qualitative insight to illuminate how financial flows translate into women’s empowerment and enterprise growth.

Beyond accountability, the MEL function has a **strategic role in learning and adaptation**. By embedding complexity-aware evaluation approaches—such as outcome harvesting, contribution analysis, and developmental evaluation—the Secretariat can generate actionable insights for AFAWA management and donors. This ensures that GETF is not only compliant with AfDB reporting standards but also responsive to the evolving realities of gender financing in Africa.

## 4. Risk Management (expand bullets)

* **Data heterogeneity and timeliness**: Risks arise from varied partner data systems and uneven reporting capacity. This will be mitigated by harmonized templates, automated validation, and quarterly data reviews to ensure alignment before synthesis.
* **Partner capacity gaps**: Many partners may have limited M\&E expertise. To mitigate, targeted MEL trainings, on-demand DQA support, and simple guidance notes will be provided, ensuring both compliance and capacity strengthening.
* **System adoption**: A common risk is low uptake of new digital systems. To address this, early co-design workshops, user-friendly UX, and step-by-step SOPs will be developed. Dedicated “office hours” will be offered for troubleshooting.
* **Attribution vs. contribution**: In multi-stakeholder environments, attributing outcomes to GETF alone is difficult. Triangulation of data, contribution analysis, and outcome harvesting will clarify how GETF adds value without overclaiming.
* **Data privacy and ethics**: Given sensitive information on women entrepreneurs, risks around confidentiality exist. Mitigation includes access controls, informed consent protocols, and secure storage consistent with AfDB and donor policies.

---

### 2. Methodology Subsections – Expanded

#### 2.1 Design & Alignment

The first step will be to **map the GETF theory of change to AFAWA’s corporate M\&E framework**. This ensures alignment between donor commitments, AfDB reporting standards, and the practical work of implementing partners. For each grant or partner, intervention-level results chains will be developed to show the logical link from inputs to gender-transformative outcomes.
To make this operational, **Indicator Reference Sheets (IRS)** will be drafted with formulas, definitions, and disaggregation categories (sex, age, sector, geography). Each indicator will specify data sources, collection frequency, and responsible parties. By building clarity upfront, the MEL system will reduce inconsistencies and enable reliable aggregation across diverse partners.

#### 2.2 Systems & Tools

A **platform-agnostic online MEL system** will be configured to serve as the central hub for data entry, validation, and visualization. The system will include role-based access for partners, automated checks for data quality, and built-in audit trails. ETL (Extract–Transform–Load) pipelines will standardize incoming datasets, minimizing manual errors and improving timeliness.
In addition, a suite of **harmonized templates** will be introduced, covering baseline survey tools, reporting forms, case study briefs, and training attendance sheets. These will not only standardize reporting but also provide user-friendly guidance to partners, ensuring greater adoption and comparability across projects.

#### 2.3 Execution & Coordination

Execution will begin with a **partner orientation workshop**, where MEL requirements and templates are explained and tested. This collaborative approach will increase partner buy-in and smooth adoption of the new system. Quarterly data calls and reviews will follow, ensuring that information flows consistently and that emerging issues are flagged early.
Coordination with AfDB’s **Delivery, Performance, and Results Department** will be prioritized so that GETF outputs are fully integrated into AfDB’s corporate systems. The consultant will also maintain a live, auditable database with metadata and version control, which provides both compliance assurance and institutional memory.

#### 2.4 Learning & Communication

Learning is a **central pillar** of the MEL function. Beyond reporting, the consultant will generate practical evidence products—such as donor reports, synthesis notes, slide decks, and short knowledge briefs—that communicate insights to different audiences. After-action reviews will be organized with partners to reflect on progress and adapt strategies.
To ensure visibility, **stories of significant change** will be documented, highlighting women entrepreneurs who benefit directly from GETF support. These narratives will complement quantitative results, giving donors a more holistic view of impact while enhancing AFAWA’s advocacy and communication efforts.

#### 2.5 Evaluation Support

The consultant will scope and quality-assure **mid-term and final evaluations**, ensuring that methods are appropriate for gender-sensitive programming. A combination of **contribution analysis, outcome harvesting, and most significant change (MSC)** will be deployed, capturing both expected and unanticipated results.
In addition, **management response tracking** will be institutionalized so that evaluation recommendations are not only documented but also acted upon. This ensures that learning loops are closed, and that findings inform future resource allocation and program adjustments.

Perfect — here’s a **fully fleshed-out Risk Management section** that turns each bullet into a proper 3–4 sentence strategy, ready to paste directly into the proposal:

---

## 6) Risk Management (Expanded)

**Data heterogeneity and timeliness**
Given that GETF partners operate across different sectors and geographies, their reporting systems and capacities vary widely. This creates a risk of inconsistent, incomplete, or delayed data, which undermines comparability and aggregation. To mitigate this, harmonized templates will be used across all partners, and automated data validation rules will be embedded within the online MEL system. In addition, quarterly data reviews will be convened with partners to check alignment, resolve discrepancies, and agree on corrective actions in real time.

**Partner capacity gaps**
Some implementing partners may lack sufficient M\&E staff or experience with AfDB-standard monitoring and reporting. This could result in poor data quality, weak analysis, or inconsistent adherence to reporting protocols. To address this, targeted capacity-building sessions will be conducted, supported by practical guidance notes, checklists, and on-demand DQA (Data Quality Assurance) support. By strengthening partner capacity rather than merely enforcing compliance, the Secretariat will build ownership and ensure sustainability of MEL practices beyond the consultancy period.

**System adoption**
New digital systems often face challenges in uptake due to unfamiliarity, perceived complexity, or competing partner priorities. Low adoption would undermine the intended efficiency and comparability of data collection. This risk will be addressed by involving partners early in the design phase (“co-creation”), simplifying user interfaces, and providing clear step-by-step standard operating procedures (SOPs). Dedicated “office hours” and help-desk support will ensure that users have timely assistance, reducing frustration and increasing confidence in the system.

**Attribution vs. contribution**
In a multi-stakeholder program like GETF, outcomes often result from the combined efforts of many actors, making direct attribution to a single intervention difficult. Overclaiming impact poses reputational risks, while under-acknowledging contribution can reduce donor confidence. To mitigate this, contribution analysis will be applied, triangulating quantitative results with qualitative evidence (e.g., outcome harvesting and case studies). This balanced approach will clearly position GETF’s value-add within a broader ecosystem of support for women entrepreneurs, strengthening both credibility and donor trust.

**Data privacy and ethics**
Monitoring gender-sensitive programming involves collecting potentially sensitive information from women entrepreneurs, such as financial records, personal details, and stories of lived experience. Without safeguards, there is a risk of breaches in confidentiality, which could expose beneficiaries to harm or violate donor policies. This will be mitigated by implementing strict access controls within the MEL system, ensuring that data is anonymized where possible, and requiring informed consent at the point of collection. Secure digital storage consistent with AfDB IT standards and donor agreements will further ensure compliance and ethical integrity.

## 1) Implications for MEL

**A portfolio with multiple implementing partners requires harmonized results chains, indicator definitions, and reporting cycles.**
The GETF portfolio spans financial intermediaries, accelerators, incubators, research institutions, and public entities, each with distinct objectives and reporting practices. Without harmonization, results cannot be compared or aggregated across partners, creating gaps in accountability and donor reporting. By developing a unified set of results chains, clear indicator definitions, and synchronized reporting cycles, the Secretariat ensures consistency and comparability. This also reduces the reporting burden on partners, who can align to one system rather than respond to multiple parallel requirements.

**The M\&E online system must consolidate data (quantitative + qualitative) and ensure traceability for baselines, targets, and results—enabling quarterly/semester/annual reporting and mid-term/final reviews.**
Given the diversity of data types, the MEL system must integrate both numerical indicators and qualitative narratives, ensuring they feed into one coherent evidence base. Traceability features—such as audit trails, metadata, and version control—are essential to maintain credibility and donor confidence. This functionality enables seamless production of quarterly, semi-annual, and annual reports, as well as mid-term and final reviews that draw directly from the consolidated system. Ultimately, the MEL system will act as both an accountability tool and a learning engine for adaptive management.

**Gender-transformative impact must be made visible through sex-disaggregated indicators and case studies capturing significant change for women-led MSMEs.**
A core aim of GETF is to demonstrate how financial interventions translate into tangible empowerment for women entrepreneurs. This requires more than counting outputs: it requires systematically disaggregating indicators by sex, sector, and geography, while also documenting qualitative evidence of change. Case studies and stories of significant change will complement quantitative results, offering nuanced insights into barriers, successes, and pathways to transformation. By foregrounding women’s voices and experiences, the MEL function will make gender impact visible and actionable for both donors and policymakers.

## 2) Deliverables

**Inception report with MEL architecture, results chains, IRS set, DQA plan, and M\&E system implementation plan.**
The inception report will set the foundation for the consultancy, presenting the overall MEL framework in detail. It will include results chains that link partner-level activities to GETF and AFAWA outcomes, a complete set of Indicator Reference Sheets (IRS), and a Data Quality Assurance (DQA) plan. The report will also provide a roadmap for implementing the M\&E system, specifying timelines, roles, and expected outputs. Once validated, this report will serve as the baseline against which progress and compliance are measured.

**Configured M\&E online system + partner reporting templates.**
The online MEL system will be customized to GETF requirements and accessible to all implementing partners via secure logins. It will include dashboards for real-time visualization, automated validation to improve data quality, and storage protocols that ensure data integrity. Partner reporting templates will be embedded within the system to ensure consistency across actors, reducing duplication and easing the reporting burden. Together, these tools will create a streamlined, digital-first MEL environment for GETF.

**Quarterly data reviews and portfolio synthesis notes.**
Each quarter, partner data submissions will be consolidated and reviewed for accuracy, timeliness, and completeness. These sessions will not only validate data but also provide space for joint reflection with partners on trends, challenges, and lessons emerging from the portfolio. The Secretariat will then produce synthesis notes that summarize progress across all partners and identify areas requiring corrective action or strategic adaptation. This cycle ensures both compliance and continuous learning within the GETF ecosystem.

**Semi-annual results report (GETF) aligned to AfDB donor reporting standards.**
The semi-annual report will consolidate performance information from all partners, presenting results in a structured format consistent with AfDB donor reporting requirements. It will highlight progress against targets, emerging outcomes, and evidence of gender-transformative impact. The report will also include lessons learned, challenges, and recommendations for adaptive management. This product will be a key accountability tool to donors and will strengthen the Secretariat’s credibility as a results-driven platform.

**Case studies (stories of significant change) and knowledge products.**
Beyond numeric reporting, case studies will highlight individual or institutional success stories that illustrate how GETF interventions are catalyzing change. These will be collected through structured templates and interviews, ensuring methodological rigor and comparability. Knowledge products—such as policy briefs, presentations, and social media snippets—will distill lessons for wider audiences, enhancing visibility of AFAWA’s work. Together, these deliverables will serve both accountability and advocacy purposes.

**Evaluation support package (scopes/ToRs, quality assurance, management response tracking).**
The evaluation support package will include standardized scopes of work and ToRs for independent evaluations, ensuring methodological quality and gender sensitivity. The consultant will review evaluation outputs, providing feedback on rigor and alignment to donor expectations. Importantly, a system for tracking management responses will be introduced, ensuring that recommendations are not only documented but also acted upon. This package will institutionalize learning and accountability within GETF operations.

**Final handover (database, documentation, dashboard, SOPs).**
At the end of the assignment, a complete handover package will be delivered to AfDB and GETF Secretariat. This will include the fully operational MEL database, documented methodologies, configured dashboards, and standard operating procedures (SOPs). The handover ensures that institutional knowledge is retained and that the MEL system continues to function seamlessly after the consultancy concludes. This step is critical to ensuring sustainability and continuity of results measurement for AFAWA.

## 3) Staffing and Management

**Staffing: Individual consultant (remote duty station).**
The assignment will be executed by a single, highly experienced consultant with over 20 years of MEL leadership across multilateral, bilateral, and government programs. Operating from a remote duty station ensures cost-effectiveness while leveraging digital systems for real-time coordination and data management. Where required, the consultant will travel to AfDB headquarters or partner sites, with mission costs covered under AfDB rules. This staffing arrangement balances efficiency with responsiveness to project needs.

**Management: The consultant will report to the AFAWA Coordinator, who in turn coordinates with task managers and the Delivery, Performance Management & Results department.**
The management structure ensures direct accountability to the AFAWA Coordinator, who is responsible for the overall performance of GETF. The consultant will work closely with AfDB task managers overseeing specific grants, aligning MEL outputs with operational requirements. Coordination with the Delivery, Performance Management & Results (DPR) Department will ensure that GETF reporting is consistent with AfDB corporate standards. This arrangement creates a clear chain of accountability while facilitating cross-departmental learning.

**Collaboration: Financial intermediaries, incubators/accelerators, research institutions, and government entities.**
The consultant will collaborate closely with a wide range of implementing partners, each with different mandates, capacities, and reporting expectations. Engagement will be both technical—through data system support, templates, and reviews—and relational, fostering trust and buy-in for MEL processes. Collaboration will also extend to government stakeholders, ensuring alignment with national monitoring frameworks where relevant. By bridging across these diverse actors, the consultant will ensure that GETF evidence is robust, credible, and widely owned.

## 1. Background and Strategic Context

The **Affirmative Finance Action for Women in Africa (AFAWA)** is AfDB’s flagship initiative to close the \$42 billion financing gap for women-led MSMEs. Within AFAWA, the **Gender Equality Trust Fund (GETF)** serves as a multi-donor financing platform, pooling resources from bilateral and multilateral partners to catalyze gender-transformative change.

The GETF Secretariat is responsible for ensuring that financial flows are strategically deployed, lessons from implementation are captured, and donor accountability requirements are met. Operationalizing such a facility requires an **adaptive MEL system** capable of managing complexity across diverse implementing partners—financial intermediaries, accelerators, incubators, research institutions, and government entities.

The MEL function must therefore harmonize data practices, combine rigorous quantitative tracking with qualitative insights, and illuminate how financial flows translate into women’s empowerment and enterprise growth.

Beyond accountability, MEL also has a **strategic learning role**—embedding approaches such as outcome harvesting, most significant change, contribution analysis, and developmental evaluation to generate actionable insights. This ensures that GETF is not only compliant with AfDB standards but also responsive to the evolving realities of gender financing in Africa.
