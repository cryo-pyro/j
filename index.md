Awesome—I've drafted both the **Technical Proposal** and the **Financial Proposal** in one place for easy editing. You’ll see them on the canvas to the right, with clear sections, deliverables, a 6-month workplan, and a fee template you can tune.

Quick highlights + checks (mapped to the RFP & ToR + your CV):

* **Submission format & deadline.** Two **separate** files (Tech + Financial) by email, due **Fri, Sept 12, 2025, 17:00 (Abidjan time)**; duration **6 months (renewable)**; submit DACON number with your proposals.&#x20;
* **Scope & duties.** The draft mirrors the ToR: build an adaptive **MRM/M\&E online system**, harmonize indicators, coordinate partner reporting, run quarterly/semi-annual reviews, produce donor reports, case studies, and support evaluations/management responses.&#x20;
* **Evaluation weights (per RFP).**

  * General qualifications – **30%**
  * Similar experience & ToR understanding – **50%**
  * MDB/DFI experience – **10%**
  * Language proficiency – **10%**
    Note: The email you pasted listed language at 30%, but the **RFP shows 10%**—I aligned to the RFP.&#x20;
* **Your alignment (from CV).**

  * 20+ years M\&E across **USAID, AfDB, WFP, DFID, DANIDA, Government of Uganda** → speaks to **general qualifications (30%)** and **MDB/DFI experience (10%)**.
  * Led USAID/Uganda MEL (US\$47m support project), built ProMIS at WFP (scaled regionally), AfDB M\&E specialist (Education II, >US\$33m), FINMAP PFM reform MEL (GoU) → strong **similar experience (50%)**.
  * Languages: **English—excellent; French—basic**; the draft frames English primary with working knowledge of French.&#x20;
* **Remuneration modality.** Monthly **lump-sum**; you cover medical insurance/accommodation; AfDB covers mission travel/per-diem; remote duty station. The Financial Proposal uses a monthly-rate table you can set to your target.&#x20;

### What I need from you to finalize

1. **Monthly rate** you want to bid (I put an editable example).
2. **DACON number** (once you register).
3. Any **AfDB/DFI references** you’d like emphasized (I pulled from your CV, but we can foreground specific contacts).&#x20;
4. Whether you want payments **monthly** or **milestone-linked** (I provided both options).

If you'd like, I can instantly split the canvas into **two separate, submission-ready docs (PDF/Word)** with a short **transmittal email** pre-addressed to the three AfDB contacts.
