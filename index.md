I've drafted both the **Technical Proposal** and the **Financial Proposal** in one place for easy editing. You’ll see them on the canvas to the right, with clear sections, deliverables, a 6-month workplan, and a fee template you can tune.

# Technical Proposal (Draft)

**Assignment:** Monitoring and Evaluation Consultant to Support the Operationalization of the Multi‑Donor Gender Equality Trust Fund (GETF)
**Applicant:** Martin Muwaga
**Date:** 12 September 2025 (to match RFP deadline timezone)
**Submission:** Technical and financial proposals to be submitted in **separate files** by email.

---

## 1) Executive Summary

I propose to lead the Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (MEL) function for the GETF Secretariat, establishing an adaptive Monitoring & Results Measurement (MRM) system, coordinating data collection and partner reporting, and producing high‑quality donor reports and knowledge products aligned to AfDB standards. With 20+ years of experience across USAID, AfDB, UN WFP, DFID/UK, Government of Uganda, and DANIDA programmes, I will consolidate GETF data flows (grants to FIs, incubators/accelerators, research institutions, and public entities), embed gender‑transformative indicators, and strengthen evidence for decision‑making toward AFAWA’s objective of unlocking finance for women entrepreneurs.

---

## 2) Understanding of the Assignment and Context

**Strategic context:** GETF under AFAWA supports (i) the effective implementation of AFAWA and (ii) gender‑transformative lending and non‑lending operations via multi‑donor grants. The Consultant works within the GETF Secretariat, under the AFAWA Coordinator, to monitor progress, evaluate outcomes, and ensure efficient delivery.

**Implications for MEL:**

* A portfolio with multiple implementing partners requires harmonised results chains, indicator definitions, and reporting cycles.
* The M\&E online system must consolidate data (quantitative + qualitative) and ensure traceability for baselines, targets, and results—enabling quarterly/semester/annual reporting and mid‑term/final reviews.
* Gender‑transformative impact must be made visible through sex‑disaggregated indicators and case studies capturing significant change for women‑led MSMEs.

---

## 3) Methodology and Workplan

### 3.1 Approach

1. **Design & Alignment**

   * Map GETF theory of change to AFAWA M\&E plan; develop intervention‑level results chains for each grant/partner.
   * Define indicator reference sheets (IRS) with clear formulas, disaggregation, data sources, collection frequency, and responsible parties.
   * Establish data quality assurance (DQA) protocols (validity, reliability, integrity, precision, timeliness).

2. **Systems & Tools**

   * Configure an **AFAWA M\&E online system** (platform‑agnostic) supporting partner onboarding, data entry/ETL, validations, and dashboards.
   * Develop harmonised templates: baseline survey tools, partner reporting forms, training attendance sheets, case‑study briefs, and evaluation TOR templates.

3. **Execution & Coordination**

   * Run a partner MEL orientation; institute quarterly data reviews and semi‑annual portfolio synthesis.
   * Coordinate with AfDB Delivery/Performance/Results colleagues for alignment with Bank standards.
   * Maintain an M\&E database with audit trails and documentation.

4. **Learning & Communication**

   * Produce evidence briefs, donor reports, slide decks, and web/social snippets.
   * Lead after‑action reviews; curate lessons learned and best practices; propose adaptive management actions.

5. **Evaluation Support**

   * Scope and quality‑assure mid‑term/final evaluations; track management responses and uptake of recommendations.

### 3.2 Indicative 6‑Month Workplan

* **Month 1:** Inception; document review; MEL alignment workshop; draft results chains; draft IRS; system configuration plan.
* **Month 2:** Baseline plans; partner onboarding to M\&E system; DQA plan; first quarterly data call.
* **Month 3:** Database live; portfolio dashboard v1; capacity building for partners; first quarterly synthesis note.
* **Month 4:** Case‑study pipeline; knowledge product outline; support mid‑term reviews; corrective actions from DQA.
* **Month 5:** Semi‑annual results report; evidence brief(s) on gender‑transformative lending; update dashboards.
* **Month 6:** Lessons learned compendium; evaluation scopes/ToRs; management response tracking; handover package.

### 3.3 Deliverables

1. Inception report with MEL architecture, results chains, IRS set, DQA plan, and M\&E system implementation plan.
2. Configured M\&E online system + partner reporting templates.
3. Quarterly data reviews and portfolio synthesis notes.
4. Semi‑annual results report (GETF) aligned to AfDB donor reporting standards.
5. Case studies (stories of significant change) and knowledge products.
6. Evaluation support package (scopes/ToRs, quality assurance, management response tracking).
7. Final handover (database, documentation, dashboard, SOPs).
