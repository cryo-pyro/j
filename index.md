# A. Technical Proposal (Draft)

**Assignment:** Monitoring and Evaluation Consultant to Support the Operationalization of the Multi‑Donor Gender Equality Trust Fund (GETF)
**Applicant:** Martin Muwaga
**Date:** 12 September 2025 (to match RFP deadline timezone)
**Submission:** Technical and financial proposals to be submitted in **separate files** by email.

---

## 1) Executive Summary

I propose to lead the Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (MEL) function for the GETF Secretariat, establishing an adaptive Monitoring & Results Measurement (MRM) system, coordinating data collection and partner reporting, and producing high‑quality donor reports and knowledge products aligned to AfDB standards. With 20+ years of experience across USAID, AfDB, UN WFP, DFID/UK, Government of Uganda, and DANIDA programmes, I will consolidate GETF data flows (grants to FIs, incubators/accelerators, research institutions, and public entities), embed gender‑transformative indicators, and strengthen evidence for decision‑making toward AFAWA’s objective of unlocking finance for women entrepreneurs.

---

## 2) Understanding of the Assignment and Context

**Strategic context:** GETF under AFAWA supports (i) the effective implementation of AFAWA and (ii) gender‑transformative lending and non‑lending operations via multi‑donor grants. The Consultant works within the GETF Secretariat, under the AFAWA Coordinator, to monitor progress, evaluate outcomes, and ensure efficient delivery.

**Implications for MEL:**

* A portfolio with multiple implementing partners requires harmonised results chains, indicator definitions, and reporting cycles.
* The M\&E online system must consolidate data (quantitative + qualitative) and ensure traceability for baselines, targets, and results—enabling quarterly/semester/annual reporting and mid‑term/final reviews.
* Gender‑transformative impact must be made visible through sex‑disaggregated indicators and case studies capturing significant change for women‑led MSMEs.

# B.  📄 Technical Proposal – Expanded Draft

## 1. Strategic Context (expand to 2–3 paragraphs)

The Affirmative Finance Action for Women in Africa (AFAWA) is the African Development Bank’s flagship initiative to close the \$42 billion financing gap for women-led small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). Within this initiative, the **Gender Equality Trust Fund (GETF)** serves as a multi-donor financing platform, pooling resources from bilateral and multilateral partners to catalyze gender-transformative change. The GETF Secretariat is tasked with ensuring that financial flows are strategically deployed, that lessons from implementation are captured, and that donor accountability requirements are fully met.

Operationalizing such a facility requires an **adaptive Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) system** capable of managing complexity across diverse implementing partners—including financial intermediaries, accelerators, incubators, research institutions, and government entities. Each partner brings unique mandates, data practices, and capacity levels. Harmonizing these within a single results framework, while ensuring comparability across contexts, is critical. The MEL function must therefore combine rigorous quantitative tracking with qualitative insight to illuminate how financial flows translate into women’s empowerment and enterprise growth.

Beyond accountability, the MEL function has a **strategic role in learning and adaptation**. By embedding complexity-aware evaluation approaches—such as outcome harvesting, contribution analysis, and developmental evaluation—the Secretariat can generate actionable insights for AFAWA management and donors. This ensures that GETF is not only compliant with AfDB reporting standards but also responsive to the evolving realities of gender financing in Africa.

## 4. Risk Management (expand bullets)

* **Data heterogeneity and timeliness**: Risks arise from varied partner data systems and uneven reporting capacity. This will be mitigated by harmonized templates, automated validation, and quarterly data reviews to ensure alignment before synthesis.
* **Partner capacity gaps**: Many partners may have limited M\&E expertise. To mitigate, targeted MEL trainings, on-demand DQA support, and simple guidance notes will be provided, ensuring both compliance and capacity strengthening.
* **System adoption**: A common risk is low uptake of new digital systems. To address this, early co-design workshops, user-friendly UX, and step-by-step SOPs will be developed. Dedicated “office hours” will be offered for troubleshooting.
* **Attribution vs. contribution**: In multi-stakeholder environments, attributing outcomes to GETF alone is difficult. Triangulation of data, contribution analysis, and outcome harvesting will clarify how GETF adds value without overclaiming.
* **Data privacy and ethics**: Given sensitive information on women entrepreneurs, risks around confidentiality exist. Mitigation includes access controls, informed consent protocols, and secure storage consistent with AfDB and donor policies.

---

## 📊 Financial Proposal – Key Updates

---

### 2. Methodology Subsections – Expanded

#### 2.1 Design & Alignment

The first step will be to **map the GETF theory of change to AFAWA’s corporate M\&E framework**. This ensures alignment between donor commitments, AfDB reporting standards, and the practical work of implementing partners. For each grant or partner, intervention-level results chains will be developed to show the logical link from inputs to gender-transformative outcomes.
To make this operational, **Indicator Reference Sheets (IRS)** will be drafted with formulas, definitions, and disaggregation categories (sex, age, sector, geography). Each indicator will specify data sources, collection frequency, and responsible parties. By building clarity upfront, the MEL system will reduce inconsistencies and enable reliable aggregation across diverse partners.

#### 2.2 Systems & Tools

A **platform-agnostic online MEL system** will be configured to serve as the central hub for data entry, validation, and visualization. The system will include role-based access for partners, automated checks for data quality, and built-in audit trails. ETL (Extract–Transform–Load) pipelines will standardize incoming datasets, minimizing manual errors and improving timeliness.
In addition, a suite of **harmonized templates** will be introduced, covering baseline survey tools, reporting forms, case study briefs, and training attendance sheets. These will not only standardize reporting but also provide user-friendly guidance to partners, ensuring greater adoption and comparability across projects.

#### 2.3 Execution & Coordination

Execution will begin with a **partner orientation workshop**, where MEL requirements and templates are explained and tested. This collaborative approach will increase partner buy-in and smooth adoption of the new system. Quarterly data calls and reviews will follow, ensuring that information flows consistently and that emerging issues are flagged early.
Coordination with AfDB’s **Delivery, Performance, and Results Department** will be prioritized so that GETF outputs are fully integrated into AfDB’s corporate systems. The consultant will also maintain a live, auditable database with metadata and version control, which provides both compliance assurance and institutional memory.

#### 2.4 Learning & Communication

Learning is a **central pillar** of the MEL function. Beyond reporting, the consultant will generate practical evidence products—such as donor reports, synthesis notes, slide decks, and short knowledge briefs—that communicate insights to different audiences. After-action reviews will be organized with partners to reflect on progress and adapt strategies.
To ensure visibility, **stories of significant change** will be documented, highlighting women entrepreneurs who benefit directly from GETF support. These narratives will complement quantitative results, giving donors a more holistic view of impact while enhancing AFAWA’s advocacy and communication efforts.

#### 2.5 Evaluation Support

The consultant will scope and quality-assure **mid-term and final evaluations**, ensuring that methods are appropriate for gender-sensitive programming. A combination of **contribution analysis, outcome harvesting, and most significant change (MSC)** will be deployed, capturing both expected and unanticipated results.
In addition, **management response tracking** will be institutionalized so that evaluation recommendations are not only documented but also acted upon. This ensures that learning loops are closed, and that findings inform future resource allocation and program adjustments.
